# Arduino-Voice-Recognition-Project
A plan of what I need to do.

In general: I want to build a robot that moves a leg on a chosen voice command.\

-I need to look at what tools I have available for the speech recognizer\
-Find out what each piece is responsible for, why it exists, how it works (and if it is compatible with my project idea)\
-See if I can set up a specific word to be recognized OR if it only works with a general voice sound\
-Figure out how to physically connect Arduino Nano + Motor leg + Voice Recognizer to make it work\
    (with that, I need to learn to understand why the wires are connected the way they are)\
-Look up examples of code to make such a mechanism move the leg by default automatically once something is said to the voice recognizer\
  (and again, understand what each line of code stands for)\
  
  
 Additional?\
 
 -Maybe see if I can make the mechanism do other things, such as light a built-in bulb blink\
